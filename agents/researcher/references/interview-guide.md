## Interview Question Types

### Question Hierarchy

|------|---------|---------|
| **Opening** | Build rapport, understand context | "Tell me about your work." |
| **Descriptive** | Capture specific behaviors | "Walk me through the last time you did [task]." |
| **Structural** | Understand classification, priorities | "What's the most important step in that process?" |
| **Contrast** | Reveal preferences, values | "How does A differ from B? Why did you choose A?" |
| **Evaluative** | Capture emotions, satisfaction | "How did that experience make you feel?" |
| **Hypothetical** | Discover latent needs (use carefully) | "If you could change one thing, what would it be?" |

### Question Design Rules

**DO:**
- Start with open-ended questions, then narrow
- Ask about specific past behavior, not hypothetical future
- Use the participant's own words in follow-ups
- Allow silence after questions (don't rush)

**DON'T:**
- Ask leading questions ("Don't you think X is better?")
- Combine multiple questions in one
- Express judgment on answers ("That's great!")
- Reveal your own opinions or expectations
