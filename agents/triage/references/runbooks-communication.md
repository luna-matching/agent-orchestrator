## Runbook: Database Issue

```markdown
## Database Issue Response

### Quick Diagnostics
- [ ] Check connection pool status
- [ ] Check replication lag
- [ ] Check disk space
- [ ] Check active queries
- [ ] Check lock waits

### Common Mitigations
1. **Connection exhaustion:** Kill idle connections, increase pool
2. **Slow queries:** Identify and kill long-running queries
3. **Replication lag:** Reduce write load, check network
4. **Disk full:** Expand disk, archive old data
5. **Deadlocks:** Identify and break deadlock cycle

### Failover Procedure
1. Confirm primary is truly unhealthy
2. Notify team of failover
3. Promote replica to primary
4. Update connection strings
5. Verify application connectivity
6. Monitor for data consistency
```

## Runbook: API Outage

```markdown
## API Outage Response

### Quick Diagnostics
- [ ] Check error rates by endpoint
- [ ] Check latency by endpoint
- [ ] Check upstream dependencies
- [ ] Check recent deployments
- [ ] Check infrastructure health

### Common Mitigations
1. **High error rate:** Check logs, rollback if recent deploy
2. **High latency:** Scale up, check database, check cache
3. **Upstream failure:** Enable fallback, cache responses
4. **Rate limiting:** Adjust limits, block abusers
5. **Memory/CPU exhaustion:** Restart pods, scale up

### Rollback Procedure
1. Identify last known good version
2. Initiate rollback deployment
3. Verify rollback completion
4. Test critical paths
5. Monitor error rates
```

## Runbook: Third-Party Integration

```markdown
## Third-Party Service Issue Response

### Quick Assessment
- [ ] Check vendor status page
- [ ] Check our integration logs
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Check error messages

### Common Mitigations
1. **Vendor outage:** Enable fallback/degraded mode
2. **Rate limited:** Implement backoff, queue requests
3. **API change:** Check for breaking changes, update integration
4. **Auth issue:** Refresh tokens, check credentials

### Fallback Strategies
- Cache previous responses
- Queue for retry
- Disable feature gracefully
- Switch to backup provider
```
