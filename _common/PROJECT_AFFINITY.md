# Project Affinity Matrix

Maps each agent to the project types where it provides the most value. Used by Nexus for intelligent routing and team assembly.

---

## Project Type Definitions

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **SaaS** | Web application with user accounts, subscriptions, multi-tenant | B2B/B2C platforms, productivity tools |
| **E-commerce** | Online store with cart, checkout, inventory, payments | Shopify stores, marketplace platforms |
| **Dashboard** | Admin panel, analytics, data visualization, CRUD interfaces | CMS admin, monitoring dashboards |
| **CLI** | Command-line tool, terminal utilities | Developer tools, automation scripts |
| **Library** | Reusable package, SDK, framework | npm packages, API clients |
| **API** | Backend API service, microservices | REST/GraphQL backends, webhook services |
| **Mobile** | Mobile application (React Native, responsive-first) | iOS/Android apps, PWAs |
| **Static** | Static site, blog, documentation site | Marketing pages, blogs, docs sites |
| **Data** | Data pipeline, analytics, ETL/ELT | Batch processing, streaming, ML pipelines |

## Affinity Levels

| Level | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **High** | H | Agent is highly relevant; should be included in most workflows |
| **Medium** | M | Agent is useful but not essential; include when scope demands it |
| **Low** | — | Agent has minimal relevance; include only for specific edge cases |

## Usage by Nexus

### Team Assembly

When Nexus receives a task and knows the project type, use this matrix to:

1. **Must-include**: Universal agents + agents with H affinity for the project type
2. **Consider**: Agents with M affinity (include if task scope demands it)
3. **Skip**: Agents with — affinity (unless explicitly requested)

### Example: SaaS Authentication Feature

```yaml
Project_Type: SaaS
Task: "Add OAuth2 authentication"

Must-include (H for SaaS):
  - Builder (implementation)
  - Sentinel (security)
  - Radar (testing)
  - Gateway (API design)
  - Schema (user model)
  - CEO (business decision)

Consider (M for SaaS):
  - Quill (API docs)
  - Stream (event logging)

Skip (— for SaaS):
  - Reel (CLI demos)
  - Anvil (CLI tools)
```

### Example: CLI Tool Development

```yaml
Project_Type: CLI
Task: "Build a database migration CLI"

Must-include (H for CLI):
  - Anvil (CLI/TUI)
  - Reel (demo recording)
  - Builder (core logic)

Consider (M for CLI):
  - Forge (prototype)
  - Echo (UX walkthrough)
  - Quill (help text / README)
  - Launch (release management)
  - Arena (multi-engine approach)

Skip (— for CLI):
  - Artisan (frontend)
  - Growth (SEO/CRO)
  - Retain (engagement)
  - CEO (business decision)
```

---

## In-File Format

Each agent's SKILL.md includes a compact `PROJECT_AFFINITY` tag in its CAPABILITIES_SUMMARY HTML comment:

```
PROJECT_AFFINITY: SaaS(H) E-commerce(H) Dashboard(H) Mobile(H) Static(M)
```

For universal agents:
```
PROJECT_AFFINITY: universal
```

Nexus reads these tags during routing to make informed team assembly decisions.
